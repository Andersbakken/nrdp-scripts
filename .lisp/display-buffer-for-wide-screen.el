;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Set `display-buffer-function' to
;; `display-buffer-function-according-to-window-width'. It determines
;; how to split window according to `window-width'. The threshold
;; value is 125 by default.

;; Below are customizable option list:
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put display-buffer-for-wide-screen.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'display-buffer-for-wide-screen)
;;
;; No need more.

;;; Customize:
;;
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET display-buffer-for-wide-screen RET
;;


;;; Bug Report:
;;
;; If you have problem, send a bug report via M-x display-buffer-for-wide-screen-send-bug-report.
;; The step is:
;;  0) Setup mail in Emacs, the easiest way is:
;;       (setq user-mail-address "your@mail.address")
;;       (setq user-full-name "Your Full Name")
;;       (setq smtpmail-smtp-server "your.smtp.server.jp")
;;       (setq mail-user-agent 'message-user-agent)
;;       (setq message-send-mail-function 'message-smtpmail-send-it)
;;  1) Be sure to use the LATEST version of display-buffer-for-wide-screen.el.
;;  2) Enable debugger. M-x toggle-debug-on-error or (setq debug-on-error t)
;;  3) Use Lisp version instead of compiled one: (load "display-buffer-for-wide-screen.el")
;;  4) Do it!
;;  5) If you got an error, please do not close *Backtrace* buffer.
;;  6) M-x display-buffer-for-wide-screen-send-bug-report and M-x insert-buffer *Backtrace*
;;  7) Describe the bug using a precise recipe.
;;  8) Type C-c C-c to send.
